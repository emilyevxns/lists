This directory contains the java source files for a project to implement lists. Please budget extra time to complete this assignment and time to get help in the afternoons.

The lists assignment is, for many students, the hardest assignment of the block. The assignment is long with a large number of methods to implement. Debugging is tricky because errors in one method will not be visible until some other method is used. There are also many interactions between different methods (in large part because both absolute and relative access must be simultaneously supported by the list implementations).

Completing this assignment well is critical for success in this class. You will need your own working list implementations to implement later assignments. It is strongly suggested that you write tests as you go during list implementation to verify that your methods are working as you write them; trying to debug all the methods at the same time is often a recipe for pain and suffering.

You must complete 2 list implementations.
ArrayList - A list structure backed by an array
LinkedList - A list structure backed by links

IList.java  - An interface for classes that implement stacks
BadIndexException.java  - thrown if an index is not in the list
InvalidLocationException.java - thrown if the move would exit the list
Test.java   - A program showing how the list constructors will be called
ArrayList.java - implementation of an arraylist
LinkedList.java - implementation of a linked list
Link.java - implementation of a link
